The singleton patterns is to ensure that exist only one instance of a class.

The key is prevent that can be instanced without the required control that we need
in the application

We need to create a private static final field for our class that return the
class instance that we need

The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful in situations where having multiple instances of a class could cause problems or where it is important for all components of a system to share the same instance. Here are some common cases where the use of Singleton is justified:

### 1. **Shared Resource Management**
   - **Database connections**: If you have an application that connects to a database, it is efficient to use a Singleton to manage the connection. This avoids the overhead of creating multiple unnecessary connections and ensures that all components of the application use the same connection.
   - **Configuration file handler**: If an application needs to read or write to a configuration file, a Singleton can ensure that all operations are performed through a single instance, avoiding synchronization problems or concurrent access to the file.

### 2. **Global State Management**
   - **Event logging (Logger)**: A Logger is a good example of using the Singleton pattern since it requires a single instance to handle all log messages in an application. This ensures that all modules of the application send their logs to the same destination, whether it is a file, console, or a centralized logging system.
   - **Global configuration management**: If you have a configuration that is used throughout the application (e.g., environment settings), a Singleton can centralize and manage these configurations so that they are consistent across all modules.

### 3. **Resource Access Control**
   - **Thread Pool Management**: In applications that require thread management, a Singleton can be used to manage a thread pool. This ensures that the pool is unique and shared across the application, optimizing the use of system resources.
   - **Cache Management**: If an application uses a cache to store data temporarily, a Singleton can manage this cache centrally. This allows the cache to be accessible from any part of the application and prevents inconsistencies.

### 4. **Hardware Access Control**
   - **Hardware controllers**: In applications that interact with specific hardware (like printer controllers or input devices), a Singleton can ensure that hardware access is centralized and synchronized, avoiding conflicts or simultaneous accesses that could cause failures.

### 5. **Process or Service Coordination**
   - **Service coordinator**: In distributed systems, a Singleton can act as a service coordinator, ensuring that all parts of the system distribute tasks or resources uniformly and in a controlled manner.
   - **Session manager**: In web applications or systems that require maintaining user sessions, a Singleton can manage and coordinate sessions, ensuring that session policies are applied consistently.

### 6. **Global Counter Management**
   - **Object or resource counters**: If you need a global counter to keep track of instances created of a class or resources used, a Singleton can manage this counter, ensuring that the count is accurate and accessible from any part of the application.

### 7. **Implementation of Factories and Abstract Factories**
   - **Factories**: Sometimes, a Singleton is used as a factory that creates objects. This is useful if the creation of objects must follow controlled and consistent logic throughout the application.

### When **Not** to Use Singleton

It is also important to know when **not** to use a Singleton:
- **Unit testing**: Singletons can make unit testing difficult since they introduce global state and can cause tests to be dependent on each other.
- **Scalability**: If an application needs to scale and requires multiple instances of a class in different environments (e.g., in a distributed application), the Singleton can become a bottleneck.
- **Need for multiple configurations**: If your application needs multiple configurations or contexts that depend on the environment or user, a Singleton can be limiting.

### Conclusion

The Singleton pattern is useful in situations where you need a unique and global access point for a resource or service that must be shared and coordinated across the application. However, it should be used with care to avoid problems such as difficulty in unit testing or lack of flexibility in the application's design.
